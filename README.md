ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m MatÃ­as Molinas (@matiasmolinas)
  
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about Machine Learning, NLP, and Transformers, and how they can be applied to build smarter project management tools. My goal is to simplify workflows by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies.
  
ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into Transformers, Prompt Engineering, and AI Agents, exploring innovative ways to integrate these technologies into real-world applications.
  
ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss AI and project management tools! You can find me on Twitter [@matiasmolinas](https://twitter.com/matiasmolinas).

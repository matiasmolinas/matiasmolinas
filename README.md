# 👋 Hi, I’m Matías Molinas (@matiasmolinas)

🧠 I create evolving, goal-driven AI systems that orchestrate tools and agents to perform complex tasks — autonomously.  
I'm the creator of the **[Evolving Agents Toolkit (EAT)](https://github.com/matiasmolinas/evolving-agents)** — an open-source Python framework for building adaptive, multi-agent systems designed for **AI-First workflows**.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- **EAT**: Build systems that go beyond prompt chains. With a central SystemAgent, SmartLibrary, SmartAgentBus, and evolution tools, EAT enables true agent orchestration and self-improvement.
- Designing architectures that **learn, adapt, and improve** based on feedback — with modular integration of OpenAI, BeeAI, LangChain, and more.
- Exploring use cases in automation, project management, educational content creation, and complex reasoning workflows.

### 🌍 Previously
- Created **Project Copilot**, an AI Project Manager that turns conversations and documents into structured backlogs.
- Built 3D medical visualization systems, ML models for healthcare, and prompt workflow engines before it was cool.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect
I'm always up to discuss AI agents, adaptive systems, or open-source collaboration.
